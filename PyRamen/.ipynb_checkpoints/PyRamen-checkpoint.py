"""PyRamen Homework"""
"""
Created by Joe Geoghegan

The purpose of this code is to utilize a ramen menu (csv file) and sales data and generate a report dictionary to a text file. The report outputs each ramen type as the keys of the dictionary. 
    Dictionary: <ramen type>{01-count, 02-revenue, 03-cogs, 04-profit metrics}
